Hello! Welcome to the repository for the code and data used in my dissertation titled "Evaluating the Accessibility of Demand Responsive Transport (DRT) Zones in Greater Manchester". This repository contains all the notebooks necessary to reproduce the results presented in my dissertation.

This repository consists of 3 Notebooks: A, B, and C, according to the sequence of the whole process.

A. Supply and Demand Variables: Calculates each variable for supply and demand, whether it's density, proximity, or percentage. There are 2 supply variables and 6 demand variables.

B. Indices: Calculates public transportation supply, public transportation demand, and DRT demand indices.

C. Spatial Clustering: Identifies clusters using Global and Local Moran's I. Proposed DRT zones are generated from this notebook.

For all the data required, please download from this link: https://1drv.ms/f/c/39244df87434c101/Eqs6v7wE_vlFmu4hV5P-1c4BP7kb203elPgadMLv5zB2fw?e=1eIZPd
